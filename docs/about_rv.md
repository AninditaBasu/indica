This API contains metadata from Rig Veda Samhita. Data from the other three samhitas (Yajurveda, Samaveda, and Atharvaveda) are not included, mainly because most of the verses in these three samhitas are a repetition of the verses in Rig Veda Samhita. 
		
For the data, the following books were consulted:
