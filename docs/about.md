# About these APIs

Do we know what life was like in ancient India? Well, that depends. To begin with, `ancient` itself is open to several definitions. And secondly, our knowledge of the past is fragmented. We know about ancient India through its songs and stories, transmitted orally for the most part from one generation to the next.

Indologists have sifted through these oral traditions and compiled scholarly books on ancient India. But, this treasure chest isn't available in a machine-readable, interoperable form. 

These APIs aim to bridge that gap. The APIs speak in JSON, which is a language notation that's understood by almost all machines today.
