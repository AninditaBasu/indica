# Contributing to Indica

:slightly_smiling_face: Thank you for wanting to help with this project.

## How you can help

First things first, we'd like all interactions in this repository to follow the [code of conduct](code-of-conduct.md).

- :bulb: Have an idea for improvement? Open an issue first, and let's talk about it. 

- :question: Have a question? See [About this project](https://aninditabasu.github.io/indica/html/about.html), and if your question remains unanswered, open an issue. 

- :beetle: Found a bug? Open an issue.

- :tada: Built an app with these APIs? Open an issue to ask it to be mentioned in the docs.

## How we work

We use labels to organize the to-do list, therefore, when opening an issue, tag it with the appropriate label (but please just stick to the ones already on the list; don't create any :smiley:). We'll respond fast (usually within 24 hours).
