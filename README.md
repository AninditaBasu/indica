# the vedic APIs

These APIs make available to you two kinds of data: data regarding the gods and poets, their categories, and poem meters used in all of the Rig Veda verses, and data regarding the descriptions of all the nouns (except proper nouns) mentioned in vedic literature.  Documentation is at https://aninditabasu.github.io/indica/. 

## Demo

An interactive demo, without you having to code or to clone or download this repo, is at https://mybinder.org/repo/AninditaBasu/indica.

## SDKs

The client libraries are in the folders with the `_SDKs` suffix. If an SDK in the language of your choice is not there, you can use the `.yaml` files in those folders to generate one through https://editor.swagger.io.

If you build an app with these APIs, please let me know. I'll update the documentation to link back to your implementation.
