## Documentation

See [Indica documentation](https://aninditabasu.github.io/indica/). 

## How to use

The APIs are openly available through `GET` calls, and return data in the `JSON` format. You can programmatically process the data to make visually appealing or easily consumable information.

> If you build an app with these APIs, please let me know. I'll include your implementation on a `Gallery` page in the documentation, and also include it under `Showcase` on this page.

## Plans for Indica

- [ ] Turn the edicts of Asoka into an API
- [ ] Turn the Arthashastra into an API
- [ ] Shall we do a Mahabharat API as well? An info-bot is up at [Mahabharat query](https://mahabharat.onrender.com) but the API is yet to be built.
